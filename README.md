## Document templates for Write ##

### How to use in [Stylus Labs Write](http://www.styluslabs.com/) ###

Download the template to your desired folder, then in Write long press on the template file and choose "Copy", then navigate to the folder where you'd like to create a new document and tap the "Copy here" button at the top of the document browser (in iOS, instead select the desired folder in the popup), long press and choose "Rename" to rename the copy and, finally, open it.  Alternatively, the template can be opened directly and then a copy saved using Document -> Save As...

This process will be streamlined in a future update to Write.


### Editing templates ###

Simple templates can be editing by manually editing the SVG file (as text).  It should be possible to edit templates in, e.g., Inkscape, but this isn't tested yet.  Send a pull request if you'd like to share your template.
